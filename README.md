## _General info_


HandiCrafti Market is a virtual flea market. By using this application, the user can sell handicrafts made by him (clothing, sculptures, paintings, etc.) or make contact with other users who would like order some stuff personalized for them. Thanks to Firebase, there is an option to register, log in, grant admin rights and authorize users, reminding or changing the password. At Home, all products added by users are visible.
